  <p>Systematic monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection cases and assessing the risk of recombinant emergence are crucial for forecasting the milestones of viral evolution and their potential clinical impact. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of more than 2 million SARS-CoV-2 samples of the COVID-19 Data Portal to identify co-infections and traces of subclonal recombination. Co-infection was reliably present in 0.33% of the investigated cases. Two independent procedures were implemented to detect evidence of subclonal recombination. We show that sensitivity is predominantly determined by the density of defining mutations along the genome, thus we used an expanded list of disjunct defining mutations of specific variant combinations to increase statistical power. We call attention to multiple challenges rendering recombinant detection difficult and estimate artifactual chimeric sequences to be present at a minimum rate of 10%, thus facilitating the mitigation of false positives studies exploring the recombination potential of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples.</p>
